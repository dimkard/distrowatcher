Distro Watcher 
--------------

Description
-----------
The specific plasmoid displays the latest releases of Linux distributions and packages, as published in distrowatch.com. In order to retrieve the relative data, RSS feeds from distrowatch are being used. 

The plasmoid consists of four distinct views:
- Distributions
- Packages
- Favorites
- News 

Switching between views can be accomplished using a tab bar. By clicking to a distribution record, default browser opens distribution's homepage at distrowatch.com. By clicking to a package record, default browser opens package's homepage. Favorites can be selected by just clicking to the relative button. Clicking to a distribution record, users are navigated to the relative distrowatch page. After choosing favorites distributions, as soon as a new release of a favorite distribution is available, a notification pop-up is displayed. Notifications can be disabled using the relative configuration option. In News tab, the latest news and updates, as published in distrowatch.com, are displayed. Navigation between news is accomplished via the relative buttons. Zoom in/out option exists as well. Horizontal and vertical layout options are provided.

Notes
-----
- Display depends on distrowatch.com RSS feeds. If the relative RSS changes or it is unavailable, plasmoid display will be broken.
- Data fetching is performed every 15 minutes (default). Users can override the default value via "Distro Watcher Settings".
- If no Internet connection is available, no data will be displayed. Instead, a notification screen is displayed. As soon as network connectivity is re-established and the next fetching point is reached, data display is restored. Users are also able to click to the Reload button and request data to be fetched again.
- Icon has been created by Máirín Duffy (mairin) and has been slightly modified. It has been downloaded from http://all-free-download.com/free-vector/download/tux-the-penguin_54375.html.
